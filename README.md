# Weather You Go

Weather You Go is an AthenaHacks 2018 project that implemented both a website and an iOS app. In general, Weather You Go 
takes the user's input for the desired time of year and temperature range, and generates locations and tourist attractions 
for the ideal vacation weather. 

This project won Best UI/UX Design Award Sponsored By Google at AthenaHacks.
